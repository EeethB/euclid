\description{
These functions allow you to create vectors of transformation matrices for
affine transformation in 2 or 3 dimensions. Transformation matrices are used
to apply transformations to geometries using \code{\link[=transform]{transform()}}. Transformations
can be stacked by multiplying them together. This is generally more
performant than applying transformations one by one to geometries.
Transformations can be reversed by applying the inverse transformation to a
geometry. The inverse transformation matrix can be obtained using
\code{inverse()}. Affine transformation matrices have an additional column and row
compared to linear transformation matrices. This means that matrices for 2
dimensional transformations are 3x3 and matrices for 2 dimensional
transformations are 4x4. In both cases the last row will consist of 0's and a
final scaling factor (usually 1). Rotation is generally not possible to do
while maintaining exactness as sine and cosine cannot be calculate to
exactness. 3 dimensional rotation can either be done around an axis, around
a direction, or be defining specific angles of rotation for yaw, pitch, and
roll.
